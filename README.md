Our project, developed in collaboration with Gajana AI for Smart India Hackathon 2024, focuses on revolutionizing agricultural disease management through artificial intelligence. 
The AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System is designed to empower farmers with early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective solutions for crop diseases.

The system leverages machine learning and computer vision models trained on diverse agricultural datasets to identify crop diseases from leaf images with high accuracy. Once a disease is detected, it provides real-time recommendations for treatment methods, preventive measures, and suitable pesticides or fertilizers, minimizing crop loss and optimizing yield.

The platform features an intuitive frontend interface, developed for ease of use by farmers and agricultural officers. It includes multilingual support, voice-enabled assistance, and offline accessibility, ensuring usability in rural and low-connectivity regions. The backend integrates Gajana AIâ€™s intelligent analytics engine, which continuously improves through user feedback and new image data, enhancing prediction accuracy over time.
